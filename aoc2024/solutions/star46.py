"""Solution for 2024 star 46.

Problem page:
    https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/23#part2

Solutions:
    1. Backtracking
        - O(2^n * n^2) time, O(n + m) auxiliary space
            where n = number of computers,
                  m = number of pairs
    2. Better backtracking
        - O(n * 2^p * p^2) time, O(n + m) auxiliary space
            where p = maximum number of neighbors of a computer
    3. Growing groups
        - O(m * p^k * klogk) time, O(n + m) auxiliary space
            where k = number of computers in the largest interconnected group

Further research:
    This is the problem of finding the maximum clique, which is a NP-complete problem.
