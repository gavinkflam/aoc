"""Solution for 2024 star 44.

Problem page:
    https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/22#part2

Solutions:
    1. Brute force, backtracking
        - O(19^4 * nk) time, O(1) auxiliary space
            where n = number of secrets,
                  k = number of generations
    2. Hash map + hash set
        - O(nk), O(nk) auxiliary space
